NodeMCU is an open source firmware for which open source prototyping board designs are available.
The name "NodeMCU" combines "node" and "MCU"(micro-controller unit).The term "NodeMCU" strictly speaking refers to the firmware
rather than the associated development kits.
  
Blynk is a Platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and
the likes over the Internet. It's a digital dashboard where you can build a graphic
interface for your project by simply dragging and dropping widgets.
